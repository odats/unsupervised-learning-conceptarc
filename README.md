# unsupervised-learning-conceptarc
Unsupervised learning on abstract visual reasoning tasks using the ConceptARC dataset. This repository explores dimensionality reduction with Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) and clustering techniques to uncover latent transformation structure in input–output grid pairs, without using task labels.
